/*
Current operating theory behind inputs is that sketch will draw a traditional radar circle with a line
within serving as the primary indicator of the robot sonar sensor. in theory (assuming input from sensor is time)
a red elipse will be drawn to represent a detected object on the radar screen.
this ellipse is drawn according to the relative position of the sensor (indicated by the blue line)
cross referenced to the time value indicated by the robot's sonar sensor (time value)
once both values are inputed into the sketch the red elipse will demonstrate the relative distance between the robot and an object.

When ever a serial even occures data will be read in 4 byte segments.  The first 2 bytes will be a magnatude and the second two bytes will be a degree measure from the device
